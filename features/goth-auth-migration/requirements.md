# Goth Authentication Migration - Requirements

## Overview
Replace the current custom OAuth implementation with [Goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth) to provide a more robust, secure, and extensible authentication system supporting multiple OAuth providers.

## Functional Requirements

### F1: OAuth Provider Support
1. The system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing GitHub OAuth integration
2. The system SHALL support adding new OAuth providers (Google, Discord, Twitter, etc.) through Goth's standardized interface
3. WHEN a new OAuth provider is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically expose login endpoints for that provider
4. The system SHALL support at least 5 popular OAuth providers initially (GitHub, Google, Discord, Twitter, Microsoft)

### F2: Authentication Flow
1. WHEN a user initiates OAuth login THEN the system SHALL redirect to the provider's authorization page with proper CSRF protection
2. WHEN a user completes OAuth authorization THEN the system SHALL handle the callback and extract user information
3. IF a user already exists with the OAuth provider connection THEN the system SHALL authenticate the existing user
4. IF a user does not exist THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and link the OAuth connection
5. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT token and set secure HTTP-only cookies

### F3: User Account Management
1. The system SHALL preserve existing user data during migration
2. The system SHALL migrate existing OAuth connections to the new Goth-based schema.
3. WHEN a user has multiple OAuth providers THEN the system SHALL allow linking/unlinking providers via the API.
4. The system SHALL preserve existing API key authentication functionality
5. The system SHALL maintain existing JWT token validation and refresh mechanisms

### F4: Security Requirements
1. The system SHALL implement CSRF protection for all OAuth flows
2. The system SHALL validate OAuth state parameters to prevent request forgery
3. The system SHALL securely store OAuth tokens (access/refresh) in the database
4. The system SHALL implement secure session management with proper token expiration
5. WHEN OAuth tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh automatically where supported

### F5: Configuration Management
1. The system SHALL support environment-based OAuth provider configuration
2. WHEN providers are configured THEN the system SHALL validate required credentials at startup
3. The system SHALL support dynamic provider enabling/disabling without code changes
4. The system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration structure

### F6: Database Migration and Schema
1. The system SHALL utilize a new, dedicated database schema for Goth-based authentication to ensure data integrity and maintainability.
2. The system SHALL migrate user connection data from the existing `auth_user_oauth_connections` table to the new schema.
3. The system SHALL handle user sessions gracefully during the migration period to avoid disrupting active users.
4. The system SHALL ensure no loss of user data or OAuth connection information during the migration.

### F7: API Compatibility
1. The system SHALL maintain existing REST API endpoints for authentication
2. The system SHALL preserve existing response formats for client compatibility
3. WHEN new providers are added THEN the system SHALL expose them through consistent API patterns
4. The system SHALL maintain existing error handling and response structures

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NF1: Performance
1. The system SHALL complete OAuth authentication flows within 3 seconds under normal conditions
2. The system SHALL support concurrent OAuth authentications without performance degradation
3. The system SHALL minimize memory footprint increase compared to current implementation

### NF2: Reliability
1. The system SHALL handle OAuth provider failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
2. The system SHALL implement retry mechanisms for transient OAuth provider errors
3. The system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for authentication services

### NF3: Maintainability
1. The system SHALL reduce OAuth implementation code complexity by leveraging Goth's abstractions
2. The system SHALL provide clear documentation for adding new OAuth providers
3. The system SHALL implement comprehensive error logging for OAuth operations

### NF4: Security
1. The system SHALL follow OAuth 2.0 security best practices
2. The system SHALL implement secure token storage and transmission
3. The system SHALL provide audit logging for authentication events

### NF5: Compatibility
1. The system SHALL maintain full backward compatibility with existing frontend applications
2. The system SHALL support existing API clients without requiring changes
3. The system SHALL preserve existing user experience during migration

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Migration Success
- [ ] All existing users can authenticate using their current OAuth connections
- [ ] No data loss during migration process
- [ ] All existing API endpoints continue to function correctly
- [ ] Frontend applications work without modifications

### AC2: New Provider Integration
- [ ] New OAuth providers can be added through configuration only
- [ ] Provider-specific login/callback endpoints are automatically created
- [ ] User information mapping works correctly for all supported providers

### AC3: Security Validation
- [ ] CSRF protection is active and tested
- [ ] OAuth state validation prevents request forgery attacks
- [ ] Token storage and transmission meet security standards
- [ ] Audit logging captures all authentication events

### AC4: Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Authentication flows complete within performance targets
- [ ] Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
- [ ] Concurrent user authentication performs adequately

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Install and configure Goth library
- Implement provider registry and configuration
- Create Goth-compatible user mapping

### Phase 2: Core Integration
- Replace OAuth handlers with Goth implementations
- Implement middleware integration
- Update provider-specific logic

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- Comprehensive testing with existing providers
- Add new provider support
- Performance and security validation

### Phase 4: Deployment
- Database migration scripts
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Monitoring and rollback procedures

## Dependencies
- Goth library (github.com/markbates/goth)
- Existing authentication infrastructure
- Database migration capabilities
- Testing framework for OAuth flows

## Constraints
- Must maintain zero-downtime deployment
- Cannot break existing user sessions
- Must preserve all existing user data and OAuth connections
- Frontend compatibility is mandatory
