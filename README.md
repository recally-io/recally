## Under the Hood

We've chosen our tech stack carefully to make Recally fast, reliable, and easy to maintain:

### Backend
- [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) for the API (because Go is fast and Echo is simple)
- [River](https://github.com/riverqueue/river) for job processing (rock-solid queue management)
- [ParadeDB](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb) (Postgres + search that actually works)

### Frontend
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) (you know it, you love it)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) (because waiting for builds is no fun)
- [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) + [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) (beautiful UI without the bloat)

### AI Magic
We use OpenAI (and compatible models) to make your content more useful through:
- Smart summaries
- Intelligent tagging
- Semantic search that understands context
